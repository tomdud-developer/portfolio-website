export const aboutMeText = <>
    I'm a 23-year-old <strong>Computer Science studentüë®‚Äçüéì</strong> at Silesian University of Technology. I also hold an <strong>engineering degreeüìú</strong> in Automatic and Robotic Control from the same institution.

    For the past three years, I have been immersing myself in the world of programming, with a particular <strong>focus on <img src='https://cdn.svgporn.com/logos/java.svg' alt='java_icon' height='25px'/>Java backend development</strong>, but as well as some exposure to <strong>React.js</strong>. While I started my programming journey with C++, it wasn't long before I fell in love with <strong>‚ù§Ô∏è<img src='https://cdn.svgporn.com/logos/java.svg' alt='java_icon' height='25px'/>Java</strong>. Currently, I'm honing my skills in Java <strong>microservices</strong> architecture and working on personal projects to further develop my abilities.

    My technology stack includes <img src='https://cdn.svgporn.com/logos/java.svg' alt='java_icon' height='25px'/>Java, along with various tools and frameworks used in backend microservices development. I'm passionate about building scalable and efficient software solutions, and I'm always seeking out new challenges to help me expand my knowledge and expertise.

    I am currently üîélooking for an <strong>internship</strong> for the position of Junior Java Backend Developer. I feel that is a good moment to start my IT career, because it's the perfect way to take it my programming to the next ‚≠êlevel.
    In the near future, my goal is to become an <strong>expert</strong> in backend development, with a strong focus on mastering microservices, cloud technology, and Kubernetes. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas to develop efficient and scalable applications.

export const projects_SpeedReadingAppProject_description="The work aims to design and create a web application that allows you to learn and improve your speed reading skills. The app offers tools to measure reading speed and text comprehension. The implemented exercises focus on accelerating perception, expanding the field of vision, excluding phonetization and regression. The application user has the option of following a training plan consisting of 21 sessions. The application is divided into two parts, backend and frontend. The backend of the application was created in Java using the Spring package. The frontend part of the application uses the React.js library. Communication between the two components takes place via the REST API. The system consisting of a database, backend and frontend application was implemented on a home server using Docker containerization technology."

        The customer is the owner of approximately 100 restaurants and serves daily diet meals over the phone. The demand for their services has consistently increased, and as a result, they require reliable software support to manage these orders. The orders should be taken on a website, where clients can potentially choose their preferred meals for each day. The restaurant location, which will serve the meals, should be assigned based on the client's domicile.
        <br/><br/>
        The dietetics team should have the option to compose meals by adding ingredients and substances. These meals should be available for every client at any location.
        <br/><br/>
        After take an order by client, he should confirm order by clicking link in email message, after that he could process the payment in PayU. After payment Order Status change to success payment and it can be processed to realisation.
        <br/><br/>
        Once a client places an order, they must confirm it by clicking a link in an email message. Upon confirmation, they can proceed to make the payment via PayU. After a successful payment, the order status will be updated to "success payment" and can be processed for realization.
        <br/><br/>
        To ensure the smooth running of operations, the restaurants must have a daily list of ingredients and meals that they need to order and prepare for the following day. This practice allows for proper planning and organization of resources, ensuring that the restaurants are adequately stocked and prepared to meet the demands of their customers.
