export const aboutMeText = "I am currently studying Computer Science at Silesian University of Technology and hold an engineering degree in Automatic and Robotic Control from the same institution. Over the past three years, I have been learning programming and gaining experience in Java backend development, as well as some exposure to React.js. I am passionate about the intersection of technology and engineering and am excited to continue expanding my skills in this field. I started my programming journey with C++, but quickly fell in love with Java. Currently, I'm focusing on learning Java microservices architecture and working on a personal project. My technology stack includes Java, React.js, and various tools and frameworks used in microservices development. I'm passionate about building scalable and efficient software solutions and am eager to continue expanding my skills in this area.";
